# VoteBox

This is a Basejump of [FreeCodeCamp](www.freecodecamp.com) who challenge to use NodeJS and other stuff to complete it.

This allows you to register, make a poll and vote. The theme of the poll can be any and give you all the options you
want for vote. <br />

## Platform

## Requisites
If you want to collaborate from your PC, you'll need some things to run the project:
  - NodeJS

Make sure that you already installed them.
